        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This project aims to build an AI-driven job recommendation system that revolutionizes how job seekers find
            employment and how employers connect with top talent. By leveraging Vultrâ€™s cloud services and advanced
            machine learning techniques, the system will analyze user profiles, job descriptions, and behavioral
            patterns to offer personalized job recommendations in real-time.</p>
        <p>With features such as skill-gap analysis, AI-driven job matching, and real-time notifications, the platform
            will streamline job search processes and improve the overall user experience.</p>

    <section class="problem-statement">
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Existing job portals lack personalization and effective job matching, often overwhelming users with
            irrelevant job postings. The process of connecting job seekers with appropriate opportunities is
            time-consuming, and many platforms fail to provide targeted recommendations that align with user profiles
            and preferences.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="solution">
        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>The AI-Based Job Recommendation System will solve this issue by implementing an AI-driven recommendation
            engine that matches users to jobs based on their profiles, resumes, and activity on the platform.</p>
